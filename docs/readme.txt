== Database Creation Scripts ==
 
New installation: Check the /atim/scripts folder for the latest database creation script. This script will create the entire database
skeleton and includes all default forms based on the CTRNet national version for Canada.

Existing installation: /atim/docs/upgrades/vX.X.X contains all database upgrade scripts for each minor version release. These need to be executed
in sequence as each release may have dependencies with earlier revisions.
